## Before You Start

Before you can build and test a Snap, you should have our experimental version of MetaMask installed. You will want to create a new browser profile or use a different browser than their regular MetaMask. Or just disable "MetaMask proper" while MetaMask Flask is running.

This fork of MetaMask for developers (Flask) does everything a proper MetaMask wallet can do, with the addition of running Snaps.

From our webpage, you can link to the chrome extension for [Flask](https://metamask.io/flask). 
__*Flask only exists as a Chrome & Firefox extension. There is no fork or experimental version of MetaMask Mobile.__

## Start Here

To get started building a Snap, follow this 5-minute tutorial teaching the basics tools, working with permissions and adding an external API: [Gas Fee Snap](https://github.com/Montoya/gas-fee-snap).

## Bounties

You can watch the [Bounties Video](https://youtu.be/wKjtDSIQLHg?t=280) from the official ETH Denver 2023 Bounties Presentation.

## Hackathon Tips

We are looking for new and interesting use cases made possible only via the Snaps platform.

Beyond innovation, practicality, functionality, and proper usage of MetaMask Snaps, which are all very important. But the communication of your idea and it's features, as well as explaining what your project does that you can't do without MetaMask Snaps, is just as important. 

For this reason we have written an [Ultimate Hackathon Survival Guide](https://consensys.net/developers/ultimate-hackathon-survival-guide/) that we really think you should check out!

## Example Snaps

## Truffle Suite Integration

If you are building with Truffle, this starter repo can help you get started with TypeScript, a Template Snap, and a [Truffle Box](https://trufflesuite.com/boxes/) for developing and testing snaps that interact with smart contracts.
